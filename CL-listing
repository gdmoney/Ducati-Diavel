Bike is in excellent mechanical and cosmetic condition. No dents or scratches, always garage kept and adult ridden. It's a great bike all around, it looks and sounds awesome and you'd be hard pressed to find anything with more of a cool factor.

However, it's just not the right fit for me. I had a sport bike before this for 6 years and I miss the more aggressive riding position. To me that's the best thing about motorcycling, there's a right bike for every rider and every use case.

Upgrades and details:
- Termignoni exhaust
- Ducati touring seat (stock seat included)
- Sato Racing frame and axle sliders
- bar end mirrors (stock mirrors included)
- Pirelli Diablo Rosso III tires still in good shape
- oil changed on 06.20.2021 at 7,500 miles

Diavel is very fast (162hp) but it has 3 different riding modes so it can also be a good fit for less experienced riders.

Pre-purchase inspections are welcome. Test rides are welcome with full asking price cash in my hand.
